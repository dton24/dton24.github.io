			<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
		</header>
				<p>Hey there! My name is Dylan and I grew up in San Jose, California. My heart truly lies in data analytics; there's something 
					so rewarding about delving into challenges and making sense of them. What makes it even more special is when I can share 
					my insights in a simple, understandable way – I believe knowledge is a gift best shared. Away from my analytical world, I 
					cherish moments playing basketball, sharing meals and laughter with friends, and savoring good food. I also find joy in 
					listening to heartwarming pop melodies, watching inspiring movies, and pondering life's philosophical wonders in my quiet moments.

			<h1>EDUCATION</h1>

			  <p>I went to Evergreen Valley High School and was involved in multiple clubs on campus. Using data as a tool 
			for decision making gave us an advantage over other clubs on campus. VSA and Interact became the two biggest 
			clubs at EVHS, and the increase in membership made me fall in love with data. Soon, I realized that Data Analytics 
			was the perfect profession for me.

			  <p>Upon completing high school, I was faced with the significant decision of choosing a university. 
				I decided on California State Polytechnic University - Pomona, a state school known for its
				community of relentless hard workers and underdogs. Cal Poly Pomona may not have the same breadth of resources that many
				private institutions boast, but it was a familiar scenario for me. I saw the limitations not as barriers,
				but as challenges that provided opportunities for growth, resilience, and innovation.
