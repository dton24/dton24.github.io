      <h3>First...</h3>
            <p> 
                I started off with a Excel Spreadsheet containing all of my data. The only problem is that the data was
                <a href = "C:\Users\dylan\Downloads\CIS 3050 PROJECTS\PROJECT 3 CIS 3050\Unnormalized Data.xls" target = "_blank">unnormalized</a>. 
                I normalized the spreadsheet data by putting it into <a href = "C:\Users\dylan\Downloads\CIS 3050 PROJECTS\PROJECT 3 CIS 3050\Normalized Data.xls" target = "_blank">third normal form</a> 
                to remove redundancy and maintain data integrity.

      <h3>After...</h3>
            <p>
                I had a clear visualization of the entities and attributes. This information was critical for my design of a data model.
                I ended up creating a <a href = "C:\Users\dylan\Downloads\CIS 3050 PROJECTS\PROJECT 3 CIS 3050\TOND-P3.erwin" target = "_blank">data model</a>
                on erwin Data Modeler by connecting these entities through branches. Once I finished designing this data model, I forward engineered it
                into SSMS. This turned my data model into a database, filled with different tables and attributes.

      <h3>Next...</h3>
            <p>
                I went back to my Excel file to access the company's data. Using different Excel techniques, such as concatenation,
                I was able to create all of my <a href = "C:\Users\dylan\Downloads\CIS 3050 PROJECTS\PROJECT 3 CIS 3050\Project 3 SQL INSERT INTO Statement.txt" target = "_blank">"INSERT INTO" statements</a>. 
                I copied and pasted these statements into a SQL query and it imported the data into these tables.

       <h3>Lastly...</h3>
            <p>
                 I performed 12 different SQL statements by using subqueries, JOIN, and aggregate functions to answer different analysis 
                questions.
